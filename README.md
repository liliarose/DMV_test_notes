# Class C DL DMV test notes
- intersection = roadway meets another roadway; ig. crosswalks, side streets, alleys, freeqay entrances, etc. 

### Speed Limits
- "Basic Speed Law": never drive faster than is safe for current conditions 
- Regardless of posted speed limits, speed depends on 
   - number and speed of other vehicles; drive slower w/ heavy traffic
   - surface of road (rough, graveled, wet, etc.(
   - PB on/crossing road 
   - weather (ie. raining, snowing, fogging, etc.); should drive slower w/ bad weather
- will be cited if driving too slowly & block normal/reasonable movement of traffic
- if driving slower than other traffic; don't drive #1 lane (fast lane), and when driver is close behind and wants to drive faster, move right. 
- The speed limit is 15 for *alleys* and *blind intersection* (w/o stop signs and can't see for 100 ft in either derection during the last 100 ft before crossing).

- 10 mph at safety zone/intersection where *street cars, trolleys, or buses* is stopped & traffic controlled by officer/light. A safety zone is marked by raised buttons or markers on the road & is for pedestrians. 
![](https://parkingtickets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NYC_NYCDOT_2.jpg)
- At *business/residential districts,* speed limit is 25 mph 

#### Railroads 
- Speed limit is 15 if within 100 ft of railroad corssing where u can't see tracks for 400 ft in both directions (like blind intersections), **but** can drive faster than 15 mph if crossing controled by gates, warning signal, or flagman. 
- Expect train on any track, at any time, and traveling in any direction. If needed to stop, wait until u can completely before crossing. 
- *Never* stop on the railroad tracks. 
- Stop b/w 15 - 50 ft from nearest track when crossing devices r active, person wards u a train is coming, or hear train sounds. 
- Do not proceed over railroad tracks until red lights stop flashing, even if gates rises. 
- If gates lowered & no approaching train, call 911 or number listed. 

### Right-of-Way Rules
- Yield right of way to prevent collisions. 
- If pedestrian crossing corner or on sidewalk, ALWAYS exercise caution & reduce speed or stop if needed 
- Don't pass vehicle stopped at sidewalk b/c pedestrian may be crossing the street 
- Don't drive on sidewalk except to cross it to enter/exit driveway/alley & YIELD to pedestrians 
- Don't stop in crosswalk. 
- If pedestrian makes eye contact, they are ready to cross the street, so YIELD. 
- **Blind** pedestrians rely on vehicle sound to become aware of ur vehicle's prescence. Make sure you stop within 5 ft of the crosswalk & for hybrid & electric vehicles, wait for the blind person to pull their cane and step away from the intersection (this means u can go; [more info](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/sharing-the-road/#blindpeds))
- **Pedestrians have the right-of-way in marked or unmarked crosswalks. Yellow may be painted at school crossings. 
- **Mountain roads:** when 2 vehicles meet on road where neither can pass, vehicle facing downhill must yield right of way by backing up until uphill vehicle can pass b/c downhill vehicle has more control. 

#### Children 
- when driving within 500 - 1k ft of school and kids r outside or crossing street, speed limit is **25 mph** unless posted otherwise (some maybe 15 mph). 
- If school grounds have no fence, NEVER drive faster than 25 mph. 
- Make sure to allow crossing guards to safely get to the side of the road. 
- Lookout for school buses; some school buses will flash yellow when preparing to stop to let kids off. Flashing yellow = slow down & stop. 
- If school buses flash red, u must stop from either direction until children are safely across the street AND lights stop flashing, but if school bus is on other side of divided or multilane highway (2+ lanes in each direction), u don't need to stop. 

#### Intersections
- w/o "STOP"/"YIELD": slow down & be ready to stop. Yield to traffic & pedestrians in or entering intersection. Yield to vehicles & bikes that arrived first or to ur right if they reached intersection at the same time as you. 
- "T" intersections w/o "STOP"/"YIELD": yield to traffic and pedestrians on the through road; they have right of way 
- *Turning left*: give right of way to all vehicles close enough to be dangerous; *safety tip* keep wheels pointed ahead until safe to start left turn b/c if pointed and vehicle hits, could be pushed into oncoming traffic. 
- on divided highways or w/ multiple lanes, watch for vehicles on the lane u cross. Turn left/right only when safe 

#### Roundabouts
Intersection where traffic travels around central island in counter-clockwise directions; no bike lanes so traffic must share road. Bikes and vehicles must yield to all traffic. 
- slow down when approaching roundabout
- yield to PB crossing roadway 
- watch for signs&pavement markings for guidance/prohited movements 
- enter roundabout when there's enough gap for traffic to merge safely. 
- travel counter clockwise; don't stop or pass
- signal when changing lanes or exiting 
- if u miss exit, continue around until u return to exit.
- W/ multiple lanes, choose entry or exit lane based on desination: 
   - turn right (blue): choose right lane and exit right lane
   - go straight (red): choose either lane and exit on the lane u entered 
   - turn left (yellow): choose left lane and exit

### Traffic Signal Lights 
- **Solid Red:** "STOP" but u can make a right turn a/g traffic signal after u stop. Yield to PBV. Don't turn if "NO TURN ON RED" sign exists 
- **Red Arrow:** "STOP" until green & do not turn a/g red arrow 
- **Flashing Red:** "STOP" and after stopping, proceed when safe. Observe right of way rules 
- **Solid Yellow:** "CAUTION"; red will appear, so stop if u can. 
- **Yellow Arrow:** "protected" until time period is ending. Obey the next traffic signal, which can be green or red 
- **Flashing Yellow:** "proceed w/ caution"; slow down & be alert before entering intersection. Yield to PBV. Don't need to stop. 
- **Flashing Yellow Arrow:** turns are permitted (unprotected), but yeild to traffic and walkers & proceed w/ caution. 
- **Solid Green:** "GO"; give right of way to PBV in intersection. only turn left if there's enough space to complete turn before creating a hazard for any oncoming PBV. Don't enter intersection if u can't completely cross before traffic signal is red. If u block intersection, u can be cited. 
- **Green Arrow:** "GO"; turn in direction arrow is pointing after yielding to PBV. u can make a "protected" turn. Oncoming PBV are stopped by red light as long as green is on 
- Blackout (broken lights): Proceed as if intersection controlled by "STOP" signs in all directions. 

### Traffic Signs
- **Stop** before white line or before entering intersection  
- **Yield** to PBV before proceeding; slow down and be ready to stop 
- *5-sided sign* = near school & stop if children r on crosswalk. 
- *4-sided diamond signs warns specific road conditions & dangers ahead. 

- a square red + white regulatary sign means u must follow the sign's instructions, like the **DO NOT ENTER** sign. **Red circle w/ red line** sign means "NO"

- Sign below approaching railroad crossing; slow down & be prepared to stop to let any trains pass first. Railroads may have blue&white signs about info if there's an emergency near tracks. 

![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 2 19 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211221928-f1e22ce4-b9c8-48ce-ab3c-3e8cc1f3fb90.jpg)

- *White Retangular* sign = MUST obey rules. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 2 26 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211222196-7b07da2b-3efd-442a-a4a3-ad1c0e91534c.jpg)
- *Yellow warning signs* = warn conditions & obey all warning signs. 
![](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/uploads/2020/02/signs2.jpg)

### Visual Search 
- *scan* the road 10-15 sec ahead of ur vehicle; constantly scaring ahead is dangerous. Use ur mirrors & know what's behind. 
- Green = ahead; blue = side; yellow = blind spots/no zones; red = behind
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 3 29 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211224355-2f55c556-38dd-437b-93fb-967618b1e207.jpg)
- before changing lanes, look into rearview window for nearby vehicles & check over shoulder for blind spots (shaded) 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 3 30 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211224381-fc31bf5c-ef98-4e5b-ab32-b1d70da7a634.jpg)

#### On the Side
- when ppl may cross/enter path, always look to left & right to make sure no one is coming 
- At intersections:
   - look both ways even if there's a red light/stop sign: 1. left first b/c they r closer to u then those coming from the right. 2. look right 3. look left again 
- don't rely on traffic lights alone b/c some drivers won't obey them. 
- Don't stay in another car's blind spot. 
- Avoid driving directly alongside other vehicles on multilane street b/c could crowd ur lane/change lanes and crash into u. Either drive ahead or behind other vehicles. 
- If possible & safe, make room for vehicles entering freeway even if u have right of way 
- at freeway exits, don't drive alongside other vehicles; driver may exit suddenly or swerve back on freeway 
- keep space b/c vehicle and parked ones b/c ppl may step out b/w them, etc. 
- always leave room b/w vehicle and motorcycles&bikes 

#### Do NOT Tailgate
- tailgate = follow too closely & can't see far ahead as they should b/c vehicle blocks their view. 
- If vehicle merges too closely, foot off accelerator to give space
- "3 second rule": if it takes 3 seconds or less to get to vehicle before u, then u're following too closely
- Allow for more space when
   - tailgater behind u; don't brake suddenly & allow space ahead. Slow down gradually or merge into another lane 
   - driving on slippery roads 
   - following motorcycles or bikes on wet/icy roads, metal surfaces, and gravel b/c they can easily fall on the surfaces. 
   - driver behind u wants to pass, allow room in front of ur vehicle so drive will have space to move in front 
   - towing trailer and carrying heavy load b/c extra weight = harder to stop
   - bus/placarded vehicle at railroad crossings b/c they must stop
   - merging onto freeway 
   
#### Behind you
Check behind before
- changing lanes; look over shoulder and don't get in way of vehicles in new lane 
- reduce speed; look at mirrors also when turning or stopping to pull into parking lot
- drive down long/steep hill; look out for large vehicles
- back up b/c its hard to see behind. When backing out of parking space:
   - check in front and behind vehicle
   - if kids nearby, make sure u can see them before backing up 
   - don't depend only on mirrors or side windows 
   - turn and look over right&left shoulders before backing. And look again over both shoulders while backing
   - back slowly to avoid collisions 
- if tailgated, brake slowly before stopping & tap brakes lightly a few times to warn tailgater; lose the tailgater ASAP 
- change lanes | slow down | pull off the road when it's safe

#### Stopping 
- if sth in path, need time to see to stop; 
- at 55mph, 400 ft | at 35 mph, ~210 ft to bring vehicle to complete stop
- Turn on lights during day if it's hard to see or can't see at least 1k ft ahead 

### Lane Control 
- **Solid** yellow: no passing if on ur side  & marks the center of road for 2 way traffic
- **Double** (yellow) solid: DO NOT pass & never drive to the left of the these lines unless u're HOV (high occupancy vehicle/carpool lane), instructed by construction or other signs, or turning left across a single set of double yellow lines to enter/exit a driveway or make U-turn 
- **Broken** yellow: may pass if safe and on ur side. 
- ** 2 sets of solid double lines w/ >2 ft apart** = barrier. Don't drive on/over barrier, make left turn, or U-turn, except at designated openings. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 01 39 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211225499-ad9d0d69-2b75-4f99-b572-d007319a0384.jpg)
- **solid** white lines = traffic lanes in same direction 
- **broken** white lines = traffic lanes on roads w/ 2+ lanes in same direction 
- **double** white (solid) lines = lane barrier b/w regular and preferential use like carpool/HOV. 
Never change langes while in these lanes; wait until single broken white line appears. 

- yield lines, aka shark's teeth, are solid white triangles across lane of traffic 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 48 06 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227184-198b152c-7747-40b7-9516-ea0b7ec35410.jpg)
- bike lanes r either painted in green or defined by solid whitle line that turns into dash near intersection. Illegal to drive unless parking (when permitted) | entering/leaving road | turning (within 200 ft of intersection). 

#### Choosing lane 
- Left or "fast" lane is num 1 lane (see below)
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 07 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211225688-bf75a7bb-e637-48f7-8b5a-9372d6570d84.jpg)
- drive in lane w/ smoothest traffic flow; try to pick middle lane and if only 2 lanes, pick right lane. 
- if driving slowly, use the right lane. 
- Don't weave in/out of traffic; stay in one lane as much as possible. 

#### Changing lanes
- change lanes = moving one lane to another, entering freeway from an on-ramp, or entering road from a curb/shoulder

Before changing lanes, look in all mirrors, and 
- check traffic behind&beside
- look over shoulder in direction u plan to move and make sure it's clear
- check for VMB in blind spots
- make sure there's enough room 

#### Passing lanes
- look ahead over shoulder for other vehicles moving into ur lane 
- pass traffic on the left; only pass right if open highway is clearly marked for 2+ lanes of travel in ur direction | driver ahead is turning left and u don't drive off the roadway to pass. Never pass on the left if driver is signaling a left turn 

#### Carpool/HOV lanes
- HOV lane is only for carpools, buses, motorcycles, or low emission vehicles w/ special DMV decal. 
- The sign at the on-ramp will tell min ppl needed for carpool/HOV lanes. 

#### Center Left Turn Lanes
- if there's such a lane (see below), u must use it to prepare for a left or u-turn
- u may only drive for 200 ft in this lane
- To turn left from this lane, signal, look over shoulder, and drive completely inside the center left turn lane. Don't stop & make sure lane is clear in both directions & only turn when safe 
- when turning left from side street/driveway, signal and wait until it's safe. Only enter when it's safe

#### Turnout Areas and Lanes
- Driving into these areas allow other cars to pass 
- if driving slowly on 2 lane where passing is unsafe or 5+ vehicles r following, must drive into turnout areas/lanes to let vehicles pass. 

#### End-of-Lane Markings
- freeway lanes most often will be marked by large broken lines.
- if driving in lane w/ these broken lines, be ready to exit or for lane to end; signs will tell u which 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 46 49 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227125-6f6594a4-25cb-4f9b-ae87-aab05079f388.jpg)

### Turns 
- **Left** turns: drive close to center diveder line or into left turn lane. Signal ~100 ft before turn. Look over shoulder, reduce speed, and stop behind limit line. Look left, right, and left again. Turn when safe. When turning left, don't turn too soon, and cut the corder of lane belonging to vehicles comming towards u. 
   - keep ur wheels pointed ahead until safe to start turn 
   - u can only make left turn a/g red light from a 1-way street to a 1-way street.
   - You may turn left into a left-moving, one-way street if there is no sign to prohibit the turn. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 51 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227307-c1dc78d2-0d65-47a2-9045-86671e63fcac.jpg)
- **Right** turns: drive close to right edge of road, if there's a bike lane, drive into bike lane no more than 200 ft before turn. Watch for PBV b/w curb and vehicle. Begin signaling 100 ft before turn. Look over right shoulder and reduce speed. Stop behind limit line. Look both ways and turn when safe. Don't turn wide into another lane; complete turn in right lane. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 56 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227516-a68b1a8f-66a6-4339-b8ea-1db8c65c5b12.jpg)
- **public transit bus lanes:** illegal to drive, stop, park, or leave vehicle in area of a road for public transit buses unless vehicle must cross lane to make turn. 
- **right turn a/g red traffic light:** signal and stop for red traffic light at limit line. You may turn fright if no sign prohibit the turn. Yield to PBV moving on their green light
- **right turn onto road w/ dedicated lane:** don't need to stop if road turning onto had a nonmerging lane dedicated to right turning vehicles and no sign prohibiting free right turn. Can proceed w/o stopping even if red traffic light located within island for vehicles proceeding straight through the intersection. If there's a light/sign on right curb of the right lane, must follow directions of that traffic signal/sign. Always yield to pedestrians 
- **NO turn a/g red arrow**
#### Examples of right/left turns
- **left turn from 2 way street:** turn 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 5 01 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227710-e605e159-810d-464f-b272-937dede4c492.jpg)


### Parking 
- on a slope: set the parking brake
- headed *downhill*: turn front wheels into curb/toward roadside
- headed *uphill*: turn wheels away from curb and let vehicle roll back a few inches 
- when no curb & on slope, turn wheels so vehicle will roll away from the center of the road if brakes fail

![](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/uploads/2020/02/parkingonhill.png)

- **white**: only stop to pick up/drop off passengers. 
- **green**: park for limited time. Look for posted sign or curb for time limits. 
- **yellow**: stop no longer than time posted to load/unload passengers/fright. Drivers of noncommercial usually required to stay in vehicle 
- **red**: no stopping, standing, parking 
- **blue**: only for disabled or driver of disabled. 

#### Parallel Parking 
1. Find a space at least 3 ft longer than vehicle & signal parking intent 
2. Pull vehicle alongside space/vehicle in front of where u want to park. Leave 2 ft b/w vehicle/space next to u and stop once rear bumper is aligned before where u want to park. Check rear and look over shoulder for approaching vehicles. Keep foot on brake and put vehicle in reverse. Maintain parking signal 

![Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 10 05 24 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211376842-00d99f54-7813-4da4-927f-c23ab98f89e4.jpg)

3. lift foot off brake. Before backing, check mirrors & shoulder for hazards. Back up at ~45 degrees angle. 

![Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 10 07 39 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211377216-f065aaec-d0a9-45fd-8987-361255f492e9.jpg)

4. Straighten out. Turn steering wheel away from curb when rear wheel is <= 18 inches from curb. Pull forward & backward to straighten out. Vehicle should be parallel & <= 18 inches from curb. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 10 09 22 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211377557-029e99ba-63ce-45c1-b1f2-1293fd7c9504.jpg)

#### Illegal Parking 
Never park when 
- on marked/unmarked crosswalk, sidewalk, partially blocking sidewalk, or before driveway 
- within 3 ft of sidewalk ramp for disabled or before curb w/ wheelchar access 
- crosshatched pattern if next to disabled parking 
- in tunnel or on bridges unless permitted by signs 
- within 15 ft of hydrant or fire station driveway
- on or within 7.5 ft of railroad track 
- b/w safety zone & curb 
- on the wrong side of street
- on freeway except for emergency, when police/device requires stop, where stop is permitted
- space designated for specific parking (ie. fuel for zero emission)

### Signaling 
- left turn = parallel hand signal 
- right turn = up 
- slow/stop = down (both lights)
Signal 
- during the last 100 ft before reaching turning pt 
- before lane changes; check mirror, over shoulder, and blind spots before changing lanes 
- at least 5 secons before changing lanes on freeway 
- before pulling next/away from curb
- when u change directions 
- if planning to turn beyond intersection. Start signaling when u're in intersection. if signal too early, other person may pull out in front of u. Remember to cancel signal after turning. 

### Steering 
- reg hp: hands at 9 & 3 o' clock or slightly lower at 8 and 4 o' clock
- *hand-to-hand steering*: aka "push/pull" steering; hands don't cross over face of steering wheel, so less chance of injury to face, arms, or hands when air bag deployed. Start hands at reg HP. Depending direction turning, one hand will push wheel up and the other down. 
- *hand-over-hand steering*: used when turning at low speeds, parking, or recovering from skid. Reg hp; depending on turn direction, one hand will push the wheel up while the other lets go and reach across the other arm and grasp the wheel and pull up. 
- *one hand steering*: recommended only when turning while backing or operating vehicle controls that require removing hand from steering wheel. 12 o'clock recommended only when backing while turning as driver must turn to see path of vehicle. Reg hp is critical to balance. 

### Signals 
Use horn 
- only when necessary, to avoid collisions 
- To get eye contact w/ other drivers; to alert other drivers of potential collisions 
- on narrow mountain roads, where u can't see at least 200 ft ahead 

Don't use horn 
- if driver/bike moves slowly and u want them to be faster 
- alert other drivers that they made a mistake b/c it might cause them to make more or become angry&retaliate
- b/c u're angry/upset
- at PBM other than to avoid collision 


Use headlights 
- if weather conditions require u to use windshield wipers, turn on low-bean headlights 
- conditions (cloud, rain, snow, etc) prevent u from seeing other vehicles. 
- on small country/mountain roads, even on sunny days 
- in the dark where visibiliy doesn't allow clear recogniition of ppl/vehicle from 1k ft 
- 30 minutes after sunset to 30 min before sunrise
- when sign says so 
- to increase vehicle visiblity; even on bright days and esp. when sun is low on the horizon. 

Emergency Signal

If collision ahead, warn drivers behind w/ emergency ahead or tapping brake pedal quickly 3-4 times (or hand signals). Never stop on roald unless for safety or to obey law. If stopping, brake ASAP to signal cars behind. 
If vehicle trouble & need to stop
- pull off road away from traffic if possible 
- if can't get off road completely, stop where ppl can see u and vehicle from behind (dont' stop over hill/around curve)
- turn emergency flashers if not moving or use turn signals 
- lift hood to signal emergency when safe
- give other drivers enough warning. Place emergency flars/triangels 200-300 ft behind. Be very careful using flares b/c may cause fires 

### Vehicle Positioning
- On 2 lane road w/ oncoming vehicle approaching & bike ahead to right. Slow down and let oncoming vehicle pass. Then, when safe, move left to give room (3+ ft) to pass bike. 
- "Split the difference" by steer middle course b/c oncoming cars and parked ones; give the room to the most dangerous situation. 
- Enter freeway at/near traffic speed. Don't stop before merging into freeway traffic, which had right of way. Follow the 3 second rule. Don't merge into too small of gap, and watch for vehicles around; mirrors, turn signals, over should to change langes/merge into traffic. 
- when entering from full stop, leave enough gap to get up to speed of other vehicles. A full block on highway and half a block on city streets 
- When turning, wait until approaching vehicle starts to turn 
- To exit freeway, signal, over shoulder, and change lanes 1 at a time until in lane to exit. Signal exit intent for ~5 sec before reaching exit, and make sure u're in proper speed for leaving traffic lane 

Dangerous ppl r
- drivers who can't see u b/c view is blocked. 
- drivers backing out of driveways/parking 
- drivers who pass u when curve/oncoming vehicles 
- drivers about to be forced into ur lane 
- pedestrians who can't see clearly (ie. umbrella)
- distracted ppl like delivery, construction workers, children, etc. 
- Confused ppl like tourists or drivers who slow down

#### Passing 
- Check for road conditions and check if there's enough room to pass when approaching vehicle, hill/curve, intersection, road obstruction, bike 
- do not pass if approaching hill/curve and can't see if other traffic is approaching or within 100 ft of an intersection bridge, tunnel, railroad crossing, etc 
- Pass traffic on the left; only pass right if open highway clearly marked for 2+ lanes of travel in ur direction | driver ahead is turning left and u do not drive off roadway to pass | on a 1 way street.
- Always signal before passing by lightly tapping on horn or briefly flashing ur lights 
- don't pull out to pass unless there's enough space to pull back 
- avoid passing other vehicles in 2 lane roads b/c increases collision chances. Don't squeeze bikes off road. 
- Look in rear view mirror, and if see both headlights in rearview mirror, there's enough room to return to previous lane. 
- If being passed, maintain speed and don't go faster

### Sharing Road 
- Trucks take longer to stop; eg. regular @55mph takes 400 ft while large truck can take 800 ft, so don't suddenly stop or slow down before big truck. 
- Trucker's blind spots; generally if u can't see truck driver in their side mirror, they can't see u either.

- Trucks must swing wide before turning right, so check signals before assuming truck's turn direction. 
- Don't cut off truck in traffic/highway to reach exit/turn. 
- Don't linger alongside truck when passing (always pass truck on left)
- Don't tailgate/follow too closely 
- Don't drive through safety zone unless in a 1 way street, when tracks too close to right that you can't pass on the right, when a traffic officers directs u to pass on the left 
- *Never* turn before an approaching light-rail vehicle 
- Check for approaching light rail 
- Yield right of way to police, fire engines, ambulance, or other emergency vehicle w/ siren and red light. Drive on the right and stop until they have passed, but **NEVER** stop at intersection (con't and then drive on right) 
- Obey order/signal given by traffic officer/police/firefighter even if it conflicts w/ existing laws
- A/g law to follow behind within 300 ft of vehicle w/ siren or flashing lights. 
- accomodate SMV (slow moving vehicles), and when sign w/ NEV (neighborhood electic vehicles), watch out for them (they can only reach 25 mph max but road limit is always <= 35 mph) 
- Slow down/stop before horses/other animals; traffic offense to scare harses or livestock 
- Motorcycles keep headlights on even during daylight hours 
- Check motorcycles when changing lanes, turning, or enter major throughfare b/c motorcycles r small & can easily appear in blind spots 
- 4 second following distance for motorcycles and give them full lane width (not illegal to share lanes, but unsafe) 
- don't pass motorcycle in the same lane u're sharing w/ them 
- move to one side of ur lane to give them enough room to pass

### Special Driving Conditions
- Curves have a strong outward pull which is very dangerous when road is slippery (ie. rain, mud snow, ice, gravel). Slow down before entering curve. Braking on curve may cause skidding 
- in heavy rain w/ 50+ mph, tires can lose contact w/ road and vehicle will be riding on water or *hydroplaning*; applying brakes, changing directions, or wind can cause vehicle to skid. If hydroplaning, slow down gradually, and don't apply brakes 
- *wet road*: reduce by 5-10 mph 
- *packed snow*: reduce speed by half 
- *ice*: slow to a crawl 
- be careful of slippery roads: shade from trees/buildings can hid ice spots; bridges/overpasses freeze first; if raining on hot day, pavement can be slippery b/c heat causes oil in asphalt to come to surface 
- *High winds*: reduce speeds, maintain firm hand position on steering wheel, look out for debris on road, don't use cruise control, and be proactive 
- Use low-beam headlights (never drive w/ just parking/fog lights) in *fog/heavy smoke*. Increase following distance and be prepared to stop. Avoid crossing or passign lanes. 
- *driving w/ sun glare*: keep inside and outside of windshield clean, maintain enough space b/w vehicles around u, and be cautious of pedestrians. 
- *driving in dark*: Use ur low-beam headlights when it rains. Use high-beam in open country or dark city streets if it's not illgal (don't blind other drivers and dim if necessary). 
- *Driving in Rain or Snow*:  turn on windshield, low beam lights, and defroster. If u cna't see further than 100 ft, don't drive past 30 mph. 
- *flooded roadways*: drive slowly if u have to and make sure brakes function properly 
- On *hill country/curves*, u must drive slowly enough to stop, and view blocked, assume another vehicle ahead. Only pass if vehicle is at least 1/3 mile away. Don't drive on the left side of the road. 
- Make sure tire PSI right; and w/ penny, if u can see top of lincoln's head; it's time for new tires.

- NEVER run engine w/ garage door closed 

#### Enforcement Stop

- Move vehicle to right shoulder of road; on freeway, move completely onto right shoulder, even if u're in carpool/HOV lane 
- End cell phone and turn off radio, and remain inside unless otherwise directed 
- Place hands in clear view, including passengers' hands, and roll down windows after vehicle stopped 

#### Green Driving 
AKA "smart" driving is used ot maximize feul efficiency and lower emissions 
- *Behavior*: accelerate & slow down smoothly, and maintain steady average speed
- *Maintenance*: keep ur vehicle in good shape 
- *Weight*: get rid of extra weight 

#### Traffic Breaks 
- Used to remove hazards, conduct emergency operations, preven traffic ollisions in heavy fog or unusually heavy traffic. 
Officer turns rear emergency lights on, slows vehicle, and drives across lanes of traffic. To help:
- Turn on emergency flashers to warn other drivers 
- slowly decrease speed; don't slow abruptly unless to avoid collision; keep same speed as officer. 
- don't pass patrol unless emergency lights r off

### Dealing With Aggressive Drivers and Road Rage
Avoid becoming aggressive by 
- allow time to reach destination 
- don't cut off other drivers
- don't drive slowly in left/fast lane 
- don't tailgate 
- don't gesture to other drivers
- use horns for emergencies only 
- let aggressive drivers pass you 

Common aggressive behaviors 
- *lane blocking* | *tailgating*
- *signal lights*: always use them when changing lanes and avoid chaning to closely to other vehicles. 
- *gestures*: don't do it in way that would be interpreted as hostile or obscene 
- *failure to turn*: unless otherwise posted, right turns r allowed after complete stop at red light. Choosing to wait may frustruate drivers behind, but it's not illegal 
- *parking* don't take more than 1 parking spot
- *headlights* dim high beam headlights for oncoming traffic and when approaching from behind 
- *merging* when permitted, make room for other cars to merge. 

### Handling Emergencies
- *skidding*: ease off gas pedal, stop braking, and turn steering wheel in direction of skid; try to find sth to stop the skid (ie. dry pavement or shoulder of the road). If brakes r wet, dry them by lightly pressing gas & brake pedals at the same time until brakes dry 
- if wheels drift off pavement, grip steering firmly, ease off gas pedal, and brake gently. Check traffic behind, and gentely steer back on pavement. 
- *Acceleration skids*: happen when wheels lose traction on road surface, so ease off gas pedal and straighten front wheels. 
- *locked wheel skids*: caused by braking too hard at a high rate of speed and locking wheels. Take foot off brake to unlock wheels, and straighten front wheels. If vehicle doesn't haave anti-lock brakes, step on brake graduailly until at safe speed, but if press brake and sinks to floor, pump pedal to build pressure, down shift to lower gear or neutral to slow down, and then use emergency/parking brake to stop. 
- *accelerator malfunction*: shift to neutral, apply brakes, keep eyes on route, look for route away from traffic, warn other drivers by honking and turning on emergency lights, drive safely off the road, and turn off the ignition. 
- **never** turn ignition to lock while still in motion. 
- avoid driving near collisions and slow down when hazard lights on. 
- If involved in collision, must stop, call 911 if anyone's hurt, move vehicle out of traffic lane, show DL, vehicle registration card, evidence of financial responsibility, and current address to ppl involved. 
- make written report to police or CHP within 24 hrs if smo killed/injured and written report to DMV within 10 days
- If hit parked vehicle/property or ur parked car rolls away and hits another vehicle, leave note with name, phone number, and address in or attached to vehicle. Report collision to police or to CHP
- if animal killed/injured, call nearest humane society, police, or CHP. Don't move animal or leave it. 
- If there's a collision, both parties must report to DMV no matter what 

### Safety Tips

- CHP FSP provides free emergency roadside services during commute times, and if they can't start it, it will be towed for free at location approved by CHP. 
- On freeway & vehicle stops running, FSP will offer a gallon of gas if runs out, jump start vehicle if dead battery, refill radiator and hoses, change flat tire, and report collisions, but it will not. tow vehicle to private repair service, recommend tow services or repair shops, tow motorcycles, assist vehicles in collisions unless directed by CHP 
- When vehiclae stalls or disabled while blocking part of train tracks, 
   - if warning lights flashing/train approching, exit vehicle and run 45 degrees away from tricks in the direction that train is coming, and dial 911. (only 20 seconds before train arrives)
