# Class C DL DMV test notes
- intersection = roadway meets another roadway; ig. crosswalks, side streets, alleys, freeqay entrances, etc. 

### Speed Limits
- "Basic Speed Law": never drive faster than is safe for current conditions 
- Regardless of posted speed limits, speed depends on 
   - number and speed of other vehicles; drive slower w/ heavy traffic
   - surface of road (rough, graveled, wet, etc.(
   - PB on/crossing road 
   - weather (ie. raining, snowing, fogging, etc.); should drive slower w/ bad weather
- will be cited if driving too slowly & block normal/reasonable movement of traffic
- if driving slower than other traffic; don't drive #1 lane (fast lane), and when driver is close behind and wants to drive faster, move right. 
- The speed limit is 15 for *alleys* and *blind intersection* (w/o stop signs and can't see for 100 ft in either derection during the last 100 ft before crossing).

- 10 mph at safety zone/intersection where *street cars, trolleys, or buses* is stopped & traffic controlled by officer/light. A safety zone is marked by raised buttons or markers on the road & is for pedestrians. 
![](https://parkingtickets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NYC_NYCDOT_2.jpg)
- At *business/residential districts,* speed limit is 25 mph 

#### Railroads 
- Speed limit is 15 if within 100 ft of railroad corssing where u can't see tracks for 400 ft in both directions (like blind intersections), **but** can drive faster than 15 mph if crossing controled by gates, warning signal, or flagman. 
- Expect train on any track, at any time, and traveling in any direction. If needed to stop, wait until u can completely before crossing. 
- *Never* stop on the railroad tracks. 
- Stop b/w 15 - 50 ft from nearest track when crossing devices r active, person wards u a train is coming, or hear train sounds. 
- Do not proceed over railroad tracks until red lights stop flashing, even if gates rises. 
- If gates lowered & no approaching train, call 911 or number listed. 

### Right-of-Way Rules
- Yield right of way to prevent collisions. 
- If pedestrian crossing corner or on sidewalk, ALWAYS exercise caution & reduce speed or stop if needed 
- Don't pass vehicle stopped at sidewalk b/c pedestrian may be crossing the street 
- Don't drive on sidewalk except to cross it to enter/exit driveway/alley & YIELD to pedestrians 
- Don't stop in crosswalk. 
- If pedestrian makes eye contact, they are ready to cross the street, so YIELD. 
- **Blind** pedestrians rely on vehicle sound to become aware of ur vehicle's prescence. Make sure you stop within 5 ft of the crosswalk & for hybrid & electric vehicles, wait for the blind person to pull their cane and step away from the intersection (this means u can go; [more info](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/sharing-the-road/#blindpeds))
- **Pedestrians have the right-of-way in marked or unmarked crosswalks. Yellow may be painted at school crossings. 
- **Mountain roads:** when 2 vehicles meet on road where neither can pass, vehicle facing downhill must yield right of way by backing up until uphill vehicle can pass b/c downhill vehicle has more control. 

#### Children 
- when driving within 500 - 1k ft of school and kids r outside or crossing street, speed limit is **25 mph** unless posted otherwise (some maybe 15 mph). 
- If school grounds have no fence, NEVER drive faster than 25 mph. 
- Make sure to allow crossing guards to safely get to the side of the road. 
- Lookout for school buses; some school buses will flash yellow when preparing to stop to let kids off. Flashing yellow = slow down & stop. 
- If school buses flash red, u must stop from either direction until children are safely across the street AND lights stop flashing, but if school bus is on other side of divided or multilane highway (2+ lanes in each direction), u don't need to stop. 

#### Intersections
- w/o "STOP"/"YIELD": slow down & be ready to stop. Yield to traffic & pedestrians in or entering intersection. Yield to vehicles & bikes that arrived first or to ur right if they reached intersection at the same time as you. 
- "T" intersections w/o "STOP"/"YIELD": yield to traffic and pedestrians on the through road; they have right of way 
- *Turning left*: give right of way to all vehicles close enough to be dangerous; *safety tip* keep wheels pointed ahead until safe to start left turn b/c if pointed and vehicle hits, could be pushed into oncoming traffic. 
- on divided highways or w/ multiple lanes, watch for vehicles on the lane u cross. Turn left/right only when safe 

#### Roundabouts
Intersection where traffic travels around central island in counter-clockwise directions; no bike lanes so traffic must share road. Bikes and vehicles must yield to all traffic. 
- slow down when approaching roundabout
- yield to PB crossing roadway 
- watch for signs&pavement markings for guidance/prohited movements 
- enter roundabout when there's enough gap for traffic to merge safely. 
- travel counter clockwise; don't stop or pass
- signal when changing lanes or exiting 
- if u miss exit, continue around until u return to exit.
- W/ multiple lanes, choose entry or exit lane based on desination: 
   - turn right (blue): choose right lane and exit right lane
   - go straight (red): choose either lane and exit on the lane u entered 
   - turn left (yellow): choose left lane and exit

### Traffic Signal Lights 
- **Solid Red:** "STOP" but u can make a right turn a/g traffic signal after u stop. Yield to PBV. Don't turn if "NO TURN ON RED" sign exists 
- **Red Arrow:** "STOP" until green & do not turn a/g red arrow 
- **Flashing Red:** "STOP" and after stopping, proceed when safe. Observe right of way rules 
- **Solid Yellow:** "CAUTION"; red will appear, so stop if u can. 
- **Yellow Arrow:** "protected" until time period is ending. Obey the next traffic signal, which can be green or red 
- **Flashing Yellow:** "proceed w/ caution"; slow down & be alert before entering intersection. Yield to PBV. Don't need to stop. 
- **Flashing Yellow Arrow:** turns are permitted (unprotected), but yeild to traffic and walkers & proceed w/ caution. 
- **Solid Green:** "GO"; give right of way to PBV in intersection. only turn left if there's enough space to complete turn before creating a hazard for any oncoming PBV. Don't enter intersection if u can't completely cross before traffic signal is red. If u block intersection, u can be cited. 
- **Green Arrow:** "GO"; turn in direction arrow is pointing after yielding to PBV. u can make a "protected" turn. Oncoming PBV are stopped by red light as long as green is on 
- Blackout (broken lights): Proceed as if intersection controlled by "STOP" signs in all directions. 

### Traffic Signs
- **Stop** before white line or before entering intersection  
- **Yield** to PBV before proceeding; slow down and be ready to stop 
- *5-sided sign* = near school & stop if children r on crosswalk. 
- *4-sided diamond signs warns specific road conditions & dangers ahead. 

- a square red + white regulatary sign means u must follow the sign's instructions, like the **DO NOT ENTER** sign. **Red circle w/ red line** sign means "NO"

- *White Retangular* sign = MUST obey rules. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 2 26 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211222196-7b07da2b-3efd-442a-a4a3-ad1c0e91534c.jpg)
- *Yellow warning signs* = warn conditions & obey all warning signs. 
![](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/uploads/2020/02/signs2.jpg)

### Visual Search 
- *scan* the road 10-15 sec ahead of ur vehicle; constantly scaring ahead is dangerous. Use ur mirrors & know what's behind. 
- Green = ahead; blue = side; yellow = blind spots/no zones; red = behind
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 3 29 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211224355-2f55c556-38dd-437b-93fb-967618b1e207.jpg)
- before changing lanes, look into rearview window for nearby vehicles & check over shoulder for blind spots (shaded) 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 3 30 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211224381-fc31bf5c-ef98-4e5b-ab32-b1d70da7a634.jpg)

#### On the Side
- when ppl may cross/enter path, always look to left & right to make sure no one is coming 
- At intersections:
   - look both ways even if there's a red light/stop sign: 1. left first b/c they r closer to u then those coming from the right. 2. look right 3. look left again 
- don't rely on traffic lights alone b/c some drivers won't obey them. 
- Don't stay in another car's blind spot. 
- Avoid driving directly alongside other vehicles on multilane street b/c could crowd ur lane/change lanes and crash into u. Either drive ahead or behind other vehicles. 
- If possible & safe, make room for vehicles entering freeway even if u have right of way 
- at freeway exits, don't drive alongside other vehicles; driver may exit suddenly or swerve back on freeway 
- keep space b/c vehicle and parked ones b/c ppl may step out b/w them, etc. 
- always leave room b/w vehicle and motorcycles&bikes 

#### Do NOT Tailgate
- tailgate = follow too closely & can't see far ahead as they should b/c vehicle blocks their view. 
- If vehicle merges too closely, foot off accelerator to give space
- "3 second rule": if it takes 3 seconds or less to get to vehicle before u, then u're following too closely
- Allow for more space when
   - tailgater behind u; don't brake suddenly & allow space ahead. Slow down gradually or merge into another lane 
   - driving on slippery roads 
   - following motorcycles or bikes on wet/icy roads, metal surfaces, and gravel b/c they can easily fall on the surfaces. 
   - driver behind u wants to pass, allow room in front of ur vehicle so drive will have space to move in front 
   - towing trailer and carrying heavy load b/c extra weight = harder to stop
   - bus/placarded vehicle at railroad crossings b/c they must stop
   - merging onto freeway 
   
#### Behind you
Check behind before
- changing lanes; look over shoulder and don't get in way of vehicles in new lane 
- reduce speed; look at mirrors also when turning or stopping to pull into parking lot
- drive down long/steep hill; look out for large vehicles
- back up b/c its hard to see behind. When backing out of parking space:
   - check in front and behind vehicle
   - if kids nearby, make sure u can see them before backing up 
   - don't depend only on mirrors or side windows 
   - turn and look over right&left shoulders before backing. And look again over both shoulders while backing
   - back slowly to avoid collisions 
- if tailgated, brake slowly before stopping & tap brakes lightly a few times to warn tailgater; lose the tailgater ASAP 
- change lanes | slow down | pull off the road when it's safe

#### Stopping 
- if sth in path, need time to see to stop; 
- at 55mph, 400 ft | at 35 mph, ~210 ft to bring vehicle to complete stop
- Turn on lights during day if it's hard to see or can't see at least 1k ft ahead 

### Lane Control 
- **Solid** yellow: no passing if on ur side  & marks the center of road for 2 way traffic
- **Double** (yellow) solid: DO NOT pass & never drive to the left of the these lines unless u're HOV (high occupancy vehicle/carpool lane), instructed by construction or other signs, or turning left across a single set of double yellow lines to enter/exit a driveway or make U-turn 
- **Broken** yellow: may pass if safe and on ur side. 
- ** 2 sets of solid double lines w/ >2 ft apart** = barrier. Don't drive on/over barrier, make left turn, or U-turn, except at designated openings. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 01 39 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211225499-ad9d0d69-2b75-4f99-b572-d007319a0384.jpg)
- **solid** white lines = traffic lanes in same direction 
- **broken** white lines = traffic lanes on roads w/ 2+ lanes in same direction 
- **double** white (solid) lines = lane barrier b/w regular and preferential use like carpool/HOV. 
Never change langes while in these lanes; wait until single broken white line appears. 

- yield lines, aka shark's teeth, are solid white triangles across lane of traffic 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 48 06 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227184-198b152c-7747-40b7-9516-ea0b7ec35410.jpg)
- bike lanes r either painted in green or defined by solid whitle line that turns into dash near intersection. Illegal to drive unless parking (when permitted) | entering/leaving road | turning (within 200 ft of intersection). 

#### Choosing lane 
- Left or "fast" lane is num 1 lane (see below)
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 07 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211225688-bf75a7bb-e637-48f7-8b5a-9372d6570d84.jpg)
- drive in lane w/ smoothest traffic flow; try to pick middle lane and if only 2 lanes, pick right lane. 
- if driving slowly, use the right lane. 
- Don't weave in/out of traffic; stay in one lane as much as possible. 

#### Changing lanes
- change lanes = moving one lane to another, entering freeway from an on-ramp, or entering road from a curb/shoulder

Before changing lanes, look in all mirrors, and 
- check traffic behind&beside
- look over shoulder in direction u plan to move and make sure it's clear
- check for VMB in blind spots
- make sure there's enough room 

#### Passing lanes
- look ahead over shoulder for other vehicles moving into ur lane 
- pass traffic on the left; only pass right if open highway is clearly marked for 2+ lanes of travel in ur direction | driver ahead is turning left and u don't drive off the roadway to pass. Never pass on the left if driver is signaling a left turn 

#### Carpool/HOV lanes
- HOV lane is only for carpools, buses, motorcycles, or low emission vehicles w/ special DMV decal. 
- The sign at the on-ramp will tell min ppl needed for carpool/HOV lanes. 

#### Center Left Turn Lanes
- if there's such a lane (see below), u must use it to prepare for a left or u-turn
- u may only drive for 200 ft in this lane
- To turn left from this lane, signal, look over shoulder, and drive completely inside the center left turn lane. Don't stop & make sure lane is clear in both directions & only turn when safe 
- when turning left from side street/driveway, signal and wait until it's safe. Only enter when it's safe

#### Turnout Areas and Lanes
- Driving into these areas allow other cars to pass 
- if driving slowly on 2 lane where passing is unsafe or 5+ vehicles r following, must drive into turnout areas/lanes to let vehicles pass. 

#### End-of-Lane Markings
- freeway lanes most often will be marked by large broken lines.
- if driving in lane w/ these broken lines, be ready to exit or for lane to end; signs will tell u which

### Turns 
- **Left** turns: drive close to center diveder line or into left turn lane. Signal ~100 ft before turn. Look over shoulder, reduce speed, and stop behind limit line. Look left, right, and left again. Turn when safe. When turning left, don't turn too soon, and cut the corder of lane belonging to vehicles comming towards u. 
   - keep ur wheels pointed ahead until safe to start turn 
   - u can only make left turn a/g red light from a 1-way street to a 1-way street.
   - You may turn left into a left-moving, one-way street if there is no sign to prohibit the turn. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 51 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227307-c1dc78d2-0d65-47a2-9045-86671e63fcac.jpg)
- **Right** turns: drive close to right edge of road, if there's a bike lane, drive into bike lane no more than 200 ft before turn. Watch for PBV b/w curb and vehicle. Begin signaling 100 ft before turn. Look over right shoulder and reduce speed. Stop behind limit line. Look both ways and turn when safe. Don't turn wide into another lane; complete turn in right lane. 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 4 56 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227516-a68b1a8f-66a6-4339-b8ea-1db8c65c5b12.jpg)
- **public transit bus lanes:** illegal to drive, stop, park, or leave vehicle in area of a road for public transit buses unless vehicle must cross lane to make turn. 
- **right turn a/g red traffic light:** signal and stop for red traffic light at limit line. You may turn fright if no sign prohibit the turn. Yield to PBV moving on their green light
- **right turn onto road w/ dedicated lane:** don't need to stop if road turning onto had a nonmerging lane dedicated to right turning vehicles and no sign prohibiting free right turn. Can proceed w/o stopping even if red traffic light located within island for vehicles proceeding straight through the intersection. If there's a light/sign on right curb of the right lane, must follow directions of that traffic signal/sign. Always yield to pedestrians 
- **NO turn a/g red arrow**
#### Examples of right/left turns
- **left turn from 2 way street:** turn 
![Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 5 01 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14303605/211227710-e605e159-810d-464f-b272-937dede4c492.jpg)

### Misc
- drivers must always yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian; At an intersection where traffic is not controlled by traffic signal lights, drivers are required to yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within any crosswalk, marked or unmarked.


### Towing
- when towing vehicle, trailer, or driving bus or 3 or more axle truck, must drive in the right most lane or the one marked for slower vehicls. If no marked lanes, there are 4 or more lanes in ur direction, u may only drive either of the 2 lanes closest to the right edge of rht eroad. 
- PBV may feel sudden strong winds when passing/being passed. SLOW down & pass safely & pass only at safe distance (>= 3 ft for bikes)

### Driving test
